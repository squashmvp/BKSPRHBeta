# BKSPRHBeta
Beta of "Practice Romhack"

Practice Romhack means I'm practicing stuff and ideas.
Robo-City is a needle in a haystack level.
Grand Piano is a collectathon with platforming.
What Boat is a story based level. 

What makes this a Beta? Here, sit down. I'll tell you.
1. There are notes in the first world to increase playability. This is due to lack of Challenges. Robo-City will not have notes in the final game. 
2. Water is buggy. Removed it in some areas for this version.
3. Texture issues in Grand Piano sections due to scale
4. Graphical issues in What Boat(Section 7) 
5. Grunty Text still plays in Hub World
6. No Boss Battle in What Boat
7. Main Surprise at end held until alpha due to Jiggy implementation bugs
8. Note door on Grand Piano doesn't work. Let's all just pretend its a 100 Note Door. 
9. There are some string to tie in What Boat in terms of the story.

Make sure to change the Memory Size from 4MB to 8MB under configs in the rom settings!

Troubleshooting:
1. Incorrect file type:
  - You can rename the output rom file to the above to fix this. Just make sure include .z64 at the end of its name if it does not already. That is the important part. That .z64 though. 

2. "Fatal Error: Emulation Stopped": 
  - Game Crashed. Duh! It happens only on specific area on the Platformer area in Grand Piano (specifically on the first shadow on the first rocky ramp after the first four clouds. That shadow thinks its water.) Any other areas, I am unaware of. 
  - Did you change the Memory size from 4mb to 8mb under configs in the rom settings?

3. Graphical Issues: 
  - Just Visual. Anything else, I am unaware of. I have no means or understanding of going about fixing this at the current moment. I run it on Jabo's Plugin for the best consistency. So that is what I will reccomend.
